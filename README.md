# Contrastive-BiSeNet-master
Combine contrastive learning with the BiSeNetV1 semantic segmentation model, where contrastive learning uses the method mentioned in "Exploring Cross Image Pixel Contrast for Semantic Segmentation".![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1eee9fe-ca0f-4a93-8174-ed492f182ff8)

Only targeted modifications have been made for bisenetv1 based on efficientnet-b3. If necessary, please run clip_m_trainv2_contrast.py
